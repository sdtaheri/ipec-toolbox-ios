Various stresses due to internal pressure are hoop stress, longitudinal stress and the radial stress. Normally the most critical stress is the hoop stress so that the pipe wall thickness should be evaluated from the hoop stress equation. \n\nIn addition to the pipeline characteristics and pressure effects, the location class must be specified according to the ASME Standards. Such additional parameter alongside with the type of pipeline product is used in calculating the required wall thickness."

Calculation of dew point temperature is required in many industrial applications such as pre-commissioning of pipelines. To avoid hydrate formation when the pipe is put into service and to attain the minimum H2O level, the pipeline is dried and brought to its dew point about -40Â°C before injection of commercial gas."
